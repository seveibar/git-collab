# Timeline

git-collab is being created through the Rensselaer Center for Open-Source, which requires a timeline with milestones for the semester.

## Pre-Documentation and Research

Complete by 9/9

git-collab requires the interfacing of many APIs and libraries. To make sure everything is understood and to help modularize the tasks and functions a research phase must be conducted. Although no coding will take place, the goal of the research phase is to have a full software design document that allows anybody to instantly pick up a portion of the project and begin work on it.

## Command line file syncing

Complete by 9/12

The simplest (and one of the most useful) pieces of functionality available within git-collab. This task requires that all the backend logic and communication is stable and able to send relatively large loads i.e. large files.

## Atom.io Skeleton

Complete by 9/12

The simple portion of the atom interface e.g. mode selection and file syncing. This task is intended to be completed in parallel with the command line file syncing.

## Atom.io Patch Testing

Complete by 9/25

Atom.io should be able to accept patches/diffs for files and have them change in real time. Atom.io should also output correct patches. This does not have to be integrated into the server.

## Atom.io Client Connections

Complete by 9/25

Atom.io should be able to connect and communicate to clients on a network and send the commands detailed in the SDD API.

## Proxy Server

Complete by 9/25

The proxy server allows anyone to host the collaborative sessions without forwarding their IP address. This isn't a necessary feature of git-collab and may be removed later.

## All command line features

Complete 9/25

All the command line modes described in the SDD and their associated libraries.

## All Atom.io Modes

Complete 10/4

All the command line functions available within atom.io via the user interface.

## Real time collaborative coding

Complete 10/9

The hardest task, creating an real time collaborative editing within atom.io.

## Deploy Site

Complete 10/17

Share the project with the world and collect issues/bug reports

## Deploy Proxy Server

Complete 10/17

Provide a service to those who cannot port forward but would like to use atom.io over the internet.

## Provide Awesome Maintenance

## Explore New Features

## Investigate Additional Hosting Features
